## Machine Learning Basic Problems
This repository contains solutions to fundamental Machine Learning problems implemented using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow. The project focuses on solving basic problems that introduce key ML concepts such as classification, regression, and neural networks.

## Problems Solved
## K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Implemented the KNN algorithm for classification tasks. This algorithm finds the nearest neighbors of a data point and classifies it based on the majority label of its neighbors.
## Logistic Regression

Used Logistic Regression for binary classification problems. It learns a linear decision boundary to separate two classes.
## Neural Networks for OR Gate

Designed a simple neural network to solve the OR gate problem, demonstrating the power of neural networks for logical operations.
## Perceptron

Implemented the Perceptron algorithm, a foundational model for classification. It learns a linear boundary to classify data into two classes.
## Probability Classification

Solved a classification problem using a probabilistic approach, calculating probabilities for class membership.
## XOR Problem with Logistic Regression

Applied Logistic Regression to solve the XOR problem, which demonstrates the limitations of linear classifiers and the need for more complex models.
## XOR Problem with Hidden Neural Network

Implemented a neural network with hidden layers to solve the XOR problem, showcasing the ability of multi-layer networks to learn non-linear patterns.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
scikit-learn for algorithms like KNN and Logistic Regression
TensorFlow for neural networks
matplotlib and seaborn for visualizations
